Documentation of output JSON documents from DeviceAnalyzer.py
--------------------------------------------------------------
The main output are JSON documents in three different (but similar) formats for different parameters settings of the DeviceAnalyzer.py script.

The parameters determining the script JSON output are:
    1. -D DEVICE, --device DEVICE 
        (DEVICE == IP Address of device, example: -D 192.168.1.1)
        JSON document contains information about the inserted device


    2. -N NETWORK, --network NETWORK  
        (NETWORK == IP Address of network, example: -N 192.168.1.0/24)
        JSON document contains information about devices from the inserted network


    3. Without previous parameters = default setting 
        JSON document contains information about all devices that were detected during the measurement

Differences in JSON documents:
        1. -D DEVICE
                    {   
                        "Name": "AnalyzeSingleDevice",

                        "Routers": [],                    
                        "Services": [],

                    }
                (“Devices”: contains only one device, that was inserted to parameter -D)

        2. -N NETWORK
                    {   
                        "Name": "AnalyzeNetwork",
                        "Network": "",

                        "Files": []
                    }

                ("Network" - IP Address of network (example: 192.168.0.0/24))

        3. Default setting (without previous parameter)
                    {
